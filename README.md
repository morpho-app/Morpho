# Morpho
Fast, flexible native Android client for Bluesky (and possibly other ATProto applications)

### Goals:  
 - Fast
 - Accessible to visually-impaired people and others with limitations
 - Supports larger screen sizes well
 - Good balance of info density and ease of use
 - Visually appealing and distinct from official app
 - Adds features official app lacks (more lists, hashtags, settings on custom feeds, muting words, GIFs, maybe a simple built-in feed creator, etc.)

### Current State:
Have a (pre)-pre-alpha-level app. Stil a ways to go before comfy doing a public release.
#### Can:
   - Scroll your timeline and pinned feeds
      - Respects settings set in official app or elsewhere 
   - View your profile and other users' (minus their feeds and lists)
   - Like and repost posts
   - Make (text) posts, replies, quote posts.
#### Missing:
   - "Warn" level content filtering
   - Image/blob upload
   - Proper BlueskyText support/parsing
   - Settings interface
   - Notifications
   - Search
   - Ability to browse custom feeds
   - View user lists
   - Subscribe to lists, feeds
   - Ability to block/mute/report
